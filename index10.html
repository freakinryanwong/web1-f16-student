	<p> Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. Hammock talk come soon.
		I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth.
		They don’t want us to eat. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life,
		take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. It’s on you how you want to live your life.
		Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused.
		It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail.
<br>
<br>
		You smart, you loyal, you a genius. We the best. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me.
		You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up.
		In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away,
		get rid of it, major key. Cloth talk. Stay focused. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy,
		beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel.
<br>
<br>
	You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up.
	To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. Life is what you make it,
	so let’s make it. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up.
	The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Let me be clear,
	you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion!
<br>
<br>
	They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Bless up. To succeed you must believe.
	When you believe, you will succeed. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows.
	You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going
	do is have lunch. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up.
<br>
<br>
	Wraith talk. Eliptical talk. We the best. They don’t want us to win. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it.
	A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. Always remember in the jungle
	there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. We don’t see them, we will never see
	them. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. The key is to
	drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me.
